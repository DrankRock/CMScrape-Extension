# CMScrape-Extension
CMScrape-Extension is a firefox add-on made to easily create list of links from CardMarket. It was specially developped to keep track of all your collection's price using [CMScrape](https://github.com/DrankRock/CMScrape).

## Install
CMScrape-Extension is available [directly on Firefox](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cmscrape/), or you can install it as a temporary add-on on your broswer of choice.

### Load a temporary add-on
#### Firefox
Open the about:debugging page, click the This Firefox option, click the Load Temporary Add-on button, then select any file in your extension's directory.

The extension now installs, and remains installed until you restart Firefox.
